# CapConvert

This is a multipurpose Discord bot to help with large or unplayable media files (eg. HEVC or HEIC format)

The bot will look for unplayable video or picture formats, and TikTok video links. It will convert them in the backround and reply to the original message with the new files. In case of long TikTok videos and large files the conversion could take 1-2 mins.

It can run locally with python3.10 interpreter. 
You can type in your TOKEN and serverID at every start or you can save it to the .env file at the first run.

## It is running on AWS - Lightsail
